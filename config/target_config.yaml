  # RFM Features for Clustering
  rfm_features:
    - recency_days            # days since last transaction (higher = more risky)
    - transaction_count       # number of transactions (lower = more risky)
    - total_amount           # total spending (lower = more risky)
    - avg_transaction_amount # average transaction value
    - std_transaction_amount # spending variability
    
  # High-Risk Identification
  risk_scoring:
    recency_weight: 1.0       # weight for recency in risk score
    frequency_weight: 1.0     # weight for frequency in risk score  
    monetary_weight: 1.0      # weight for monetary in risk score
